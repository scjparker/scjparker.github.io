          Our group uses an interdisciplinary combination of molecular/cellular
          and computational methods to understand how disease susceptibility is
          encoded in the non-coding portion of the genome. Our focus is on type
          2 diabetes (T2D) and related traits. Looking forward, our belief is
          that high-throughput biological profiling and analysis approaches will
          be closely tied to disease diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment — and
          will therefore have a tremendous influence on medicine.

        We generate and computationally analyze multiple high-throughput data
        sets on the genome (DNA-seq), epigenome (ATAC-seq), transcriptome
        (RNA-seq), and metabolome in disease-relevant cells and tissues. Our
        target tissues of interest are pancreatic islets, skeletal muscle, and
        adipose. Computational integration of these data sets with
        publically-available data sets from other cells and tissues allows us to
        discover tissue-specific and disease-relevant functional signatures.

        Our high-throughput data sets are generated across multiple species
        - currently in human, mouse, and rat. We develop and use comparative
        approaches to integrate these data sets, which allows for the
        understanding of evolutionary processes and translation of our model
        species maps at orthologous human loci.

      <p>
        In addition to generating and analyzing cross-species data sets, we generate
        and analyze molecular profiles across a diversity of human subjects.
        Integrating genome and functional profiles allows us to observe the effect of
        genetic variation on non-coding functional regions. Together, these findings
        will illuminate the basic molecular mechanisms encoding T2D and related trait
        susceptibility and will provide new insights into the foundations of metabolic
        health and longevity.
