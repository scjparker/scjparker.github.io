abstract:
    A hallmark of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is dysfunction of insulin-producing β cells in
    islets of Langerhans. T2D genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified
    hundreds of signals but translating these into biological mechanisms is challenging.
    To identify early disease-driving events, we performed integrated studies of
    short-duration T2D and control donors including pancreatic tissue single cell spatial
    proteomics and islet physiology and transcriptomics. We show that T2D is associated
    with β cell dysfunction, but not β cell loss, and define cellular neighborhood
    organizational changes in intraislet capillaries and T cells. We found that
    a transcription factor RFX6 gene regulatory network is associated with insulin
    secretion defects and T2D GWAS variants, and further validated the RFX6 role in
    β cells through direct perturbation in human pseudoislets with physiological and
    single nuclei multiome readouts. Thus, β cell-intrinsic defects, including
    RFX6-mediated β cell chromatin, transcriptome, and insulin secretion dysregulation,
    define early-stage T2D signatures.
highlights:
  - Physiological, transcriptomic, and image profiling of short-duration T2D and ND pancreatic islets
  - Co-expression network analyses identified gene modules related to donor and islet traits and revealed disrupted metabolism and cilia homeostasis in T2D 
  - β cell hub gene <b>RFX6</b> is reduced in T2D and controls glucose-stimulated insulin secretion
  - RFX6 knockdown alters the β cell chromatin and transcriptional landscape and downregulates secretory vesicle components
