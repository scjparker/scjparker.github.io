Our paper titled "Cell specificity of human regulatory annotations and their genetic effects on gene expression" is now accepeted in Genetics! We showed that stretch enhancers harbor small effect eQTL and large effect chromatinQTL, which has important implications for interpreting GWAS loci. Read the paper [here](https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.118.301525){:target="_blank"}.
