We will create cerebral organoids (with and without opioid exposure) using a cohort of 50 iPSC's and measure single-cell gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and enhancer activity across development. This will allow us to identify basal-state and responsive molecularQTL, which we will then integrate with genetic data from larger cohorts to understand regulatory elements, gene expression, biological pathways and neuronal cell types influencing opioid-linked outcomes.
