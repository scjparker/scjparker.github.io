The American Society for Human Genetics annual meeting took place in October 2025 in Boston, MA. Lab members Lovelyn Epelle, Christa Ventresca, Alice Wang, Ben Li, Maya Bose, Cynthia Zajac, and Ellie Bloss all presented posters; Adelaide Tovar gave a platform talk; and Christa Ventresca moderated a Featured Session she proposed.

Kudos to everyone!
