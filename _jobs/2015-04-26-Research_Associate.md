<b>Job Summary:</b>
<br>
Applications are invited for a Research Lab Specialist Associate position in the
laboratory of Dr. Steve Parker in the Departments of Computational Medicine
& Bioinformatics and Human Genetics at the University of Michigan Medical
School. The major goal of the lab is to generate mechanistic knowledge about how
disease susceptibility is encoded in the non-coding portion of the genome, with
a focus on type 2 diabetes. We will accomplish this through an interdisciplinary
combination of molecular/cellular and computational methods. Specifically, we
will generate multiple high-throughput data sets on the genome, epigenome,
transcriptome, and proteome across species and in disease-relevant tissues/cells
and use computational approaches to integrate and analyze this data. The lab
culture is one of openness, scientific rigor, friendliness, and general good
humor. For more information, please see the Parker lab website: <a
href="http://theparkerlab.org" target="_blank">http://theparkerlab.org</a>.
<br>
The applicant will help organize and lead research projects involving molecular
biology, genomics, and genetics, which involves critical evaluation and
presentation of scientific literature. In collaboration with senior research
faculty and personnel, participates as skilled individual contributor and/or
lead researcher on one or more research projects serving as expert in
specialized area. Responsible for administrative, financial, and planning
aspects of projects. Investigates, modifies and applies new procedures,
techniques or applications of technology, integrating new findings in field of
study. The position will focus heavily on human molecular genetic techniques
including cell culture, PCR, qPCR, gel electrophoresis, cloning, DNA and RNA
isolation, and library preparation for high-throughput sequencing. The candidate
will be responsible for processing human tissue samples and cultured cell lines
for these analyses. The candidate will work both independently and in a team
  environment for the collection of data and analysis of research results. In
  addition, the candidate will be open to learning new cutting-edge methods and
  techniques as research opportunities develop and directions change. The
  candidate will be expected to perform basic laboratory maintenance and
  ordering as well as maintaining compliance with University of Michigan safety
  and lab regulations.
<br>
<b>Qualifications:</b>
<br>
B.S. in Cell Biology, Molecular Biology, or related field and 3-5+ years of
experience in a molecular biology lab setting with excellent cell culture and
qPCR skills. M.S. degree or higher and more experience is preferred. The
candidate should have strong written and oral communication skills, maintain
laboratory records, have the ability to work under deadlines with general
guidance, and to contribute to manuscripts, grants and presentations. English
language proficiency is required.
<br>
To apply, send a CV, brief cover letter describing your research experiences and
ongoing research interests (including specific interest in this lab), and
contact information for three references to Dr. Steve Parker at <a
